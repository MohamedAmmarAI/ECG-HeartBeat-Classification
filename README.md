# ECG-HeartBeat-Classification

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the development of a machine learning model for classifying ECG (Electrocardiogram) heartbeat data. Using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, the model performs accurate heartbeat classification, assisting in the identification and evaluation of core health metrics through ECG analysis. The goal is to provide organizations with insights into heartbeat patterns, enabling better decision-making in healthcare diagnostics.

## Introduction
Electrocardiogram (ECG) data plays a crucial role in diagnosing cardiac abnormalities. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to classify heartbeat signals as either normal (0) or one of several abnormal categories (1, 2, 3, 4). The model aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy and support healthcare professionals with automated heartbeat classification.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle. It contains ECG recordings with labeled heartbeat classes, including:
- 0: Normal
- 1: Abnormal Class 1
- 2: Abnormal Class 2
- 3: Abnormal Class 3
- 4: Abnormal Class 4

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)

## Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
  1. Clone this repository:
    - git clone https://github.com/MohamedAmmarAI/ECG-HeartBeat-Classification.git
