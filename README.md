## Project Overview
This project focuses on the development of a machine learning model for classifying ECG (Electrocardiogram) heartbeat data. Using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, the model performs accurate heartbeat classification, assisting in the identification and evaluation of core health metrics through ECG analysis. The goal is to provide organizations with insights into heartbeat patterns, enabling better decision-making in healthcare diagnostics.
